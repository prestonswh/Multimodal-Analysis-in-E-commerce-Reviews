I was very nervous myself and though the other reviews helped, I still didn't feel very confident about my purchase. I can tell you now that I have no regrets and absolute trust in this company. This dress is absolutely stunning and I will buy from them again.<br /><br />Before I purchased:<br />I was very skeptical. I don't like spending that much money, especially on a dress online. I have ordered things from china before and they always came back in poor quality. I have seen many variations of this dress online and all of them ended up being very cheep like. I did not want to end up buying something I would regret later. My senior prom was coming up FAST. I had 3 weeks. The estimated tracking said it would arrive sometime a month later, but after an E Mail to the seller, I was assured the dress would be here ASAP.<br /><br />After the purchase:<br />The dress came in 10 days. I was so happy! The colors were matching beautifully. Yes the skirt is a little darker than the top, but that's because it has a thin fabric overlaying the original color. I think it looks prettier that way. The sizing is true! I got one a little bigger just in case and found out I would have been just fine ordering a size smaller. The dress is very flat. You NEED a petticoat for it to look correct! I got one off of<br />E Bay for $25 and it looked like it was meant to be.<br /><br />Possible adjustments:<br />*I could not for the life of me figure out why the front of the dress was way longer than the back! I was stepping on my dress the first few days I had it till I decided to hem it up. But my theory is that its a ""princess"" dress and princesses carry the fronts when they walk around. TADA<br />*The color of the dress is a hard color to match if you're trying to buy fabric for sleeves! I ended up buying a slightly lighter fabric with a dark thin fabric to go over it. it looked a lot like the skirt so it matched nicely!<br />*Some of the beading was coming undone so I hand stitched a few things a little tighter and they were good as new again<br /><br />Prom night:<br />We went to dinner first at a local dinner and were stopped by many guests. I was told by many people that the dress was stunning and the best of the group. A little girl even asked to take a picture with the ""Princess"". I also received many complements at the dance. Everyone was surprised I had ordered it online for the price that it was. It could easily be a $300 dress. Im not kidding, it is that beautiful. I actually won prom queen and best dress that night. It was all amazing.<br /><br />In closing:<br />I have never been so happy with a dress in my life till now. Its not only something that made my night enchanting, but its something I can hold for my future daughters and their proms. I am very happy with the sellers and I have absolute trust in their company. I will buy from them again :) If you are skeptical and a worrier like I am, don't be afraid to buy this dress.

I wear a size 10, sometimes 12, so ordered two sizes up as recommended by other reviewers. The length was a bit too long, the sleeves were so tight I was afraid I was going to rip it as I took it off, it was too tight in the bust and the waist was too loose.
